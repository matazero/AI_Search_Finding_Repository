Question 1: 
 var client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017");
           var session = client.StartSession();  
           what is the difference in between these two 
            var mongoClient = new MongoClient(settings.Value.ConnectionString);
            var mongoDatabase = mongoClient.GetDatabase(settings.Value.DatabaseName);

Answer 1:
Looking at your code examples, here are the key differences:
Connection String

First example: Uses a hardcoded localhost connection string "mongodb://localhost:27017"
Second example: Uses a connection string from configuration via settings.Value.ConnectionString

Database Access

First example: Only creates the client, no database reference
Second example: Also gets a reference to a specific database using mongoClient.GetDatabase(settings.Value.DatabaseName)

Session Management

First example: Explicitly starts a session with client.StartSession()
Second example: No session started (sessions are optional and used for transactions/consistency guarantees)

Configuration Pattern

First example: Direct hardcoding (not recommended for production)
Second example: Uses dependency injection pattern with settings (recommended approach)

Practical Differences
The second approach is better for production applications because:

Flexibility: Connection string can be changed without recompiling
Environment-specific: Different connection strings for dev/staging/production
Security: Connection strings with credentials aren't hardcoded
Convenience: You get direct access to the database object for operations

The session in the first example would be useful if you need:

Multi-document transactions
Causal consistency
Specific read/write concerns
For most basic MongoDB operations, you don't need an explicit session - the driver handles connections automatically.

Question 2: 

Mongo says: When using the .NET/C# Driver, you can create a new session from a MongoClient instance as an IClientSession type. We recommend that you reuse your client for multiple sessions and transactions instead of instantiating a new client each time.
The following example shows how to create a session by calling the StartSession() method:

var client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017");var session = client.StartSession(); 

how about the other in terms of opening connection

Answer 2:
Great question! Let me clarify how MongoDB connections work in both approaches:
Connection Behavior
Both approaches create a connection pool, not an immediate connection:
csharp// First example
var client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017");
var session = client.StartSession();

// Second example  
var mongoClient = new MongoClient(settings.Value.ConnectionString);
var mongoDatabase = mongoClient.GetDatabase(settings.Value.DatabaseName);
Key Points About MongoDB .NET Driver Connections:

Lazy Connection: MongoClient doesn't immediately open a connection when instantiated - it creates a connection pool and connects only when you perform an actual database operation.
Connection Pooling: Both approaches use the same underlying connection pooling mechanism.
GetDatabase() vs StartSession():

GetDatabase() just returns a database reference - still no actual connection opened
StartSession() also doesn't open a connection immediately - sessions are lightweight logical constructs



When Connections Actually Open:
csharp// No connection opened yet
var client = new MongoClient("connection-string");
var database = client.GetDatabase("mydb");
var collection = database.GetCollection<MyDocument>("mycollection");

// Connection opens HERE when you perform an operation
var document = await collection.FindAsync(x => x.Id == "123");
MongoDB's Recommendation
MongoDB recommends reusing the MongoClient instance because:

Connection pools are expensive to create
Each MongoClient maintains its own connection pool
Reusing clients improves performance and resource utilization

So in terms of "opening connections," both your examples behave identically - they're just different ways to configure and reference the same underlying connection pooling system.
