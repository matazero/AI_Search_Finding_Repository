What is the key difference in between Bucket and BucketAuto Mongo C# driver

Answer:
#######
The key difference between Bucket and BucketAuto in the MongoDB C# driver relates to how they group documents and define bucket boundaries:
Bucket

Manual boundary definition: You explicitly specify the boundaries for each bucket
Predetermined groups: You define exact values that determine how documents are grouped
Fixed bucket structure: The number and range of buckets are known in advance
More control: You have precise control over how data is categorized

Example:
csharpvar pipeline = new[]
{
    new BsonDocument("$bucket", new BsonDocument
    {
        {"groupBy", "$price"},
        {"boundaries", new BsonArray {0, 100, 500, 1000}},
        {"default", "Other"}
    })
};
BucketAuto

Automatic boundary calculation: MongoDB automatically determines the bucket boundaries
Equal distribution attempt: Tries to distribute documents as evenly as possible across buckets
Specify bucket count: You only specify how many buckets you want, not their boundaries
Less control, more convenience: MongoDB handles the grouping logic for you

Example:
csharpvar pipeline = new[]
{
    new BsonDocument("$bucketAuto", new BsonDocument
    {
        {"groupBy", "$price"},
        {"buckets", 4}
    })
};
When to use which:

Use Bucket when you need specific, meaningful ranges (e.g., age groups: 0-18, 18-65, 65+)
Use BucketAuto when you want to divide data into roughly equal groups for analysis without caring about specific boundary values

Both are part of MongoDB's aggregation pipeline and are useful for creating histograms and analyzing data distribution patterns.
