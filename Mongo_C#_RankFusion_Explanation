Based on the MongoDB C# driver documentation, RankFusion is used for combining and ranking results from multiple MongoDB aggregation pipelines. Here are the key details:

Purpose
RankFusion appends a $rankFusion stage to MongoDB aggregation pipelines to combine results from multiple named pipelines that operate on the same collection.

Key Features
Pipeline Combination: It takes multiple aggregation pipelines and combines their results into a unified output, allowing you to merge different query strategies or scoring approaches.
Weighted Scoring: You can assign different weights to each pipeline to control their relative importance in the final ranking. Default weight is 1 when unspecified Method RankFusion | MongoDB CSharp Driver API Reference, and weights should be non-negative
numerical values.
Flexible Configuration: The method offers three overloads:

Named pipelines with explicit weights using Dictionary collections
Array of pipelines with automatic naming ("pipeline1", "pipeline2", etc.)
Array of pipeline-weight tuples for more compact specification

Common Use Cases
Search Relevance: Combine different search strategies (text search, semantic search, popularity-based ranking) into a single ranked result set.
Recommendation Systems: Merge results from different recommendation algorithms with varying weights based on their effectiveness.
Multi-criteria Ranking: Combine rankings based on different criteria (price, rating, relevance, recency) to create comprehensive scoring.
A/B Testing: Compare different ranking strategies by running them in parallel and combining results.
The RankFusion functionality is particularly valuable when you need sophisticated ranking that considers multiple factors or when you want to leverage different MongoDB search capabilities simultaneously while maintaining a single, coherent result ranking.
